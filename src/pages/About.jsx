                      I'm a full-stack software engineer with a unique journey from psychology to technology. After earning my B.S. in Psychology from California State University, Northridge, I transitioned into software engineering through General Assembly's immersive program. This shift reflects my passion for problem-solving and creating meaningful user experiences.

                    <Typography variant="body1">
                      Currently, I serve as a freelance Software Engineer, where I contribute to innovative projects in AI, cybersecurity, and big data. My technical expertise spans frontend development with React, backend development using Node.js and Express, and mobile app development with React Native. I also have experience in operations and management, having previously worked as an Operations Specialist at Saro Lifestyle, where I implemented systems to enhance efficiency and inventory management.

                      Outside of work, I enjoy building computers and playing tennis‚Äîboth of which sharpen my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and strategic thinking. Building computers deepens my understanding of hardware-software integration, while tennis enhances my focus, agility, and ability to adapt quickly‚Äîqualities I bring into my software engineering practice.
